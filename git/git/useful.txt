Workflow Updating local repository
**************************
My local repos is missing updates and has a local file not on remote.
This is explained in git-doc/3.5/git-branching
Right way.
git fetch origin 
git pull  (synch work with remote)
git push origin main

C:\Users\jeztr\Local\Reference>git push origin main
To https://github.com/jeztrem/Reference.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jeztrem/Reference.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
