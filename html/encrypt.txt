THE LAST WORD
In summary, here is our minimum recommendation for safe storage of your users’ passwords:

Use a strong random number generator to create a salt of 16 bytes or longer.
Feed the salt and the password into the PBKDF2 algorithm.
Use HMAC-SHA-256 as the core hash inside PBKDF2.
Perform 200,000 iterations or more [October 2022].
Take 32 bytes (256 bits) of output from PBKDF2 as the final password hash.
Store the iteration count, the salt and the final hash in your password database.
Increase your iteration count regularly to keep up with faster cracking tools.
Whatever you do, don’t try to knit your own password storage algorithm.

It didn’t end well for Adobe, and it is unlikely to end well for you.
