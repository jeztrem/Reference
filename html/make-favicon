Yes, some websites may use a different favicon for light and dark media themes. 
This is known as a "favicon variant" or a "theme-color meta tag" and it is used 
to ensure that the website icon or logo is visible and legible in both light and dark modes.

To implement a favicon variant, the website can use the following meta tag in the head section of the HTML code:

html
Copy code
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff"> <!-- for light mode -->
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000"> <!-- for dark mode -->

The theme-color meta tag defines the color of the browser's user interface, 
such as the address bar, tabs, and toolbars. By specifying a different color 
for light and dark modes, the website can ensure that the favicon is visible and 
stands out in both modes.

However, it's worth noting that not all browsers support the theme-color meta 
tag or favicon variants for dark mode. Therefore, it's important for the website 
to also ensure that their favicon is visible and legible in both light and dark 
modes without relying solely on a favicon variant.
